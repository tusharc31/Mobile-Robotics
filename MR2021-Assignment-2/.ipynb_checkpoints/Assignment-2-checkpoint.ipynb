    "# Introduction to types of Transformations and Homogeneous coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotics applications, it is inevitable to keep track of the frames of multiple objects/worlds. These frames can be transformations from one coordinate frame to the other. **Homogeneous coordinates** help in keeping track of various coordinate frames and allow performing composition of various transforms. We will first try to understand between types of transformations and their invariant properties.\n",
    "1. What is the difference between Affine, Similarity, and Euclidean transform? What are the invariant properities of each type of transform?\n",
    "2. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEl63t-opM) to briefly understand homogeneous coordinates. What are points at infinity? What type of transformation can you apply to transform a point from infinity to a point that is not at infinity? \n",
    "3. Using homogeneous coordinates we can represent different types of transformation as point transforms vs. frame transforms. Concatenation of transforms (whether you post multiply transformation matrices or pre-multiply transformation matrices) depends on the problem and how you are viewing it. Try to understand the difference between frame vs. point transformations from this [video](https://youtu.be/Za7Sdegf8m8?t=1834). Let's assume that our camera and world frames are coinciding with each other. We need to estimate the camera to world **frame** transformation matrix after applying the transformations defined below in terms of $T_i$.We apply **frame** transform to move the camera in the world in the following order:\n",
    "    1. $T_1$ from the camera coordinate frame.\n",
    "    2. $T_2$ from the world coordinate frame.\n",
    "    3. $T_3$ from the world coordinate frame.\n",
